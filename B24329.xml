            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>An humble <hi>Proposal</hi> to the Honourable the <hi>House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> for Raising of large Sums of Money for Supplying the Government, Securing the Proprietors in their Estates, Quieting the minds of a multitude of His Majesty's lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Subjects, and giving Incouragement for greater Improvements.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS there has been several Grants made from the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens</hi> of <hi>England</hi> of wast Grounds and other Grounds to several persons for terms of Years, reserving very small Rent to the Crown, which several said Persons have either Sold the same or Lett to build for large Ground Rents, the Grounds thereby being credibly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and the terme of Years near expiring in some of the Grants and Leases, and some quite expired, and great inquiry being made after the expired Grants &amp; Leases, to the disquieting of abundance of His Majesteys good Subjects; and the last Parliament likewise being about inquiring into the Grants and Leases, has so much disquieted and discouraged the Proprietors that have improved the same, that they dare not further improve nor support what they have already built, nor can they Sell or Mortgage their several interests in the several Estates, as the case now stands, which is almost to their undoing.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE it is humbly offered to the Consideration and Wisdome of this Honourable House by the several Proprietors of the Improvements, and the Purchasers of the Ground-Rents and Improvements, That they may Purchase a further terme of Years (and to make the remaining terme Ninety Nine Years) at reasonable and valuable Consideration, as is customary in the Purchasing other Leases by a limitted time in the said Act; and those that have a long time to come in the said Grants and Leases to pay a Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration for confirming the same as to their several interests, And that those Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that hold any Estates, the Grants and Leases whereof are expired, may be allowed to come in and pay a reasonable and valuable consideration for new Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by a time to be limmitted▪ And that all Persons that hold their Estates by Grants or Leases from the Crown, that are expired, If they do nor come in and discover their Estates, and take new Leases as aforesaid, to be debarred from it; and if their expired Grants and Leases be discovered by others, the Persons ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such discovery, to have one Moiety for a certain terme of Years, and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to purchase a new Lease for the other Moiety.</p>
            <p>AND the several Proprietors will be contented, and do further offer to pay one half-years Rent of the vallue of their Estates upon the death of every Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor, to be paid by the next Heir or Person to whom the said Estates shall come to be reserved and payable to and vested in the Crown during the whole time of the Leases. And to prevent the concealing the Deaths of any of the Proprietors, the next Heir, Executor or Person to whom the Estates shall come, shall be oblidged, under a pennalty, in a time to be limitted, to pay the said half-years Rent at the appointed place in the Act.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE it is humbly desired that an Office may be Erected for Recording the Leases and Entring the Money paid upon the Renewing the Leases, and upon the several Deaths, and that all Grants and Leases and regular Books may be kept at the said Office And that the Masters Sallary and Fees, and the Clerks Sallary and Fees may be Regulated by the Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>THIS will quiet the minds of his Majesteys good Subjects, and be satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all Persons concerned in any of the Grants; To those that have Improved, those that have Purchased, and to those whose Grants and Leases are Expired, &amp; those that have lent their Money upon Mortgages, and be a certain Security to them all.</p>
